[00:00:00] Welcome to this Python basics course. Today we're going to cover
the fundamental building blocks of Python programming: variables and data types,
functions, and loops. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid foundation
to start writing your own Python programs.

[00:00:25] Let's start with variables. A variable in Python is a name that
refers to a value stored in memory. Unlike some other languages, Python uses
dynamic typing, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable
before using it. You simply assign a value with the equals sign.

[00:01:00] For example, you can write: name equals quote Alice quote. Here,
name is the variable and Alice is a string value. You can also create numeric
variables: age equals 30 creates an integer, and price equals 19.99 creates
a floating-point number. Python figures out the type automatically based on
the value you assign.

[00:01:45] Python has several built-in data types that you should know about.
The most common ones are: strings for text, represented with quotes; integers
for whole numbers like 1, 42, or minus 7; floats for decimal numbers like
3.14 or 2.718; booleans which are either True or False; and None which
represents the absence of a value.

[00:02:30] You can check the type of any variable using the type function.
For instance, type of name would return str, type of age returns int, and
type of price returns float. This is useful for debugging when you're not
sure what type a variable holds.

[00:03:00] Type conversion is another important concept. Sometimes you need
to convert between types. You can use int to convert a string like quote 42
quote to the integer 42. Similarly, str converts a number to a string, and
float converts to a floating-point number. Be careful though: trying to
convert a non-numeric string to int will raise a ValueError.

[00:03:45] Now let's move on to functions. A function is a reusable block of
code that performs a specific task. You define a function using the def keyword,
followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon. The
function body is indented below.

[00:04:15] Here's a simple example: def greet with parameter name, then on
the next line return quote Hello comma space quote plus name. This function
takes a name as input and returns a greeting string. You call it by writing
greet with quote Bob quote in parentheses, and it returns Hello Bob.

[00:04:50] Functions can have multiple parameters. For example, def add with
parameters a and b, return a plus b. You can also set default values for
parameters: def greet with name equals quote World quote. If you call greet
without arguments, it uses the default value and returns Hello World.

[00:05:30] The return statement sends a value back to the caller. A function
can return any type of value: a number, a string, a list, or even another
function. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it implicitly returns
None. You can also return multiple values using tuple packing: return a, b, c.

[00:06:00] Let me show you a more practical example. Let's write a function
called calculate_average that takes a list of numbers as input. Inside the
function, we check if the list is empty, and if so, return 0. Otherwise,
we return the sum of the numbers divided by the length of the list. This
demonstrates parameter handling, conditional logic, and the return statement.

[00:06:45] Now let's talk about loops. Loops allow you to repeat a block of
code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops: for loops and while
loops. The for loop is used when you want to iterate over a sequence like a
list, string, or range of numbers.

[00:07:15] The basic syntax is: for item in sequence, colon, then the loop
body indented below. For example, for fruit in a list containing apple, banana,
cherry, print fruit. This prints each fruit on a separate line. The variable
fruit takes on each value in the list one at a time.

[00:07:50] The range function is commonly used with for loops to generate a
sequence of numbers. Range 5 produces numbers 0 through 4. Range 1, 6
produces 1 through 5. Range 0, 10, 2 produces 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. This is
very useful for counting loops and index-based iteration.

[00:08:20] While loops repeat as long as a condition is True. The syntax is:
while condition, colon, then the loop body. For example, count equals 0, while
count is less than 5, print count, count equals count plus 1. This prints
numbers 0 through 4. Be careful with while loops: if the condition never
becomes False, you'll create an infinite loop.

[00:08:55] Two important keywords for controlling loop flow are break and
continue. Break immediately exits the loop entirely. Continue skips the rest
of the current iteration and moves to the next one. For example, in a for
loop iterating over numbers 0 to 9, if number equals 5 break will stop the
loop at 5, while if number modulo 2 equals 0 continue will skip even numbers.

[00:09:30] You can also nest loops inside each other. A common use case is
iterating over a 2D structure. For example, for row in range 3, for col in
range 3, print row comma col. This produces all combinations of row and
column indices. Be mindful of performance with nested loops, as the total
iterations multiply.

[00:10:00] Let's put everything together with a practical example. We'll
write a function called find_common_elements that takes two lists as parameters.
Using a for loop, we iterate over the first list, and for each element, we
check if it exists in the second list using the in operator. If it does, we
append it to a result list. Finally, we return the result list. This combines
functions, loops, conditionals, and list operations.

[00:10:40] To summarize what we've covered today: variables store data and
Python handles types dynamically; functions let you organize reusable code
with parameters and return values; and loops let you repeat operations over
sequences or while conditions hold. These three concepts form the core of
Python programming and you'll use them in virtually every program you write.

[00:11:00] In the next lesson, we'll build on these fundamentals to explore
more advanced topics like list comprehensions, dictionaries, and error
handling. Practice writing small programs using variables, functions, and
loops to solidify your understanding. Thank you for watching.
